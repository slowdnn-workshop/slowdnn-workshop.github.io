    "title": "Third Workshop on Seeking Low-Dimensionality in Deep Neural Networks (SLowDNN)",
    "content": "January 2023, MBZUAI, Abu Dhabi . We are currently in the midst of a data revolution. Massive and ever-growing datasets, arising in science, health, or even everyday life, are impacting many areas of society. Many of these datasets are not only large – they are high-dimensional, in the sense that each data point may consist of millions or even billions of numbers. A basic challenge spanning signal processing, statistics, and optimization is to leverage lower-dimensional structures in high-dimensional datasets. Low-dimensional signal modeling has driven developments both in theory and in applications to a vast array of areas, from medical and scientific imaging, to low-power sensors, to the modeling and interpretation of bioinformatics data sets, just to name a few. However, massive modern datasets pose an additional challenge: as datasets grow, data collection techniques become increasingly uncontrolled, and it is common to encounter gross errors or malicious corruptions, and nonlinearity. Classical techniques break down completely in this setting, and new theories and algorithms are needed. To meet those challenges, there have been explosive developments in the study of low-dimensional structures in high-dimensional spaces over the past two decades. To a large extent, the geometric and statistical properties of representative low-dimensional models (such as sparse and low-rank and their variants and extensions) are now well understood. Many highly efficient and scalable algorithms have been developed for recovering such low-dimensional models from high-dimensional data. The working conditions and data and computational complexities of these algorithms have also been thoroughly and precisely characterized. These theoretical results and algorithms have already revolutionized the practice of data science and signal processing, and have had significant impacts on sensing, imaging, and information processing. On the other hand, recently strong connections between deep neural networks and low-dimensional models have emerged at multiple levels, in terms of learning representations, network architectures, and optimization strategies. Such connections do not only help explain many intriguing phenomena in deep learning, but also provide new guiding principles for better network design, optimization, robustness, and generalization of deep networks in both supervised and unsupervised scenarios. Given these exciting and less-exploited connections, this workshop aims to bring together experts in machine learning, applied mathematics, signal processing, and optimization, to share recent progress and foster collaborations on the mathematical foundations of deep learning. As the community begins to embrace the power of deep learning, with unprecedented new challenges in terms of modeling and interpretability, we hope to stimulate vibrate discussions towards bridging the gap between the theory and practice of deep learning.
