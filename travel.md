# Travel Support

MBZUAI has travel grants in the amount of up to \$1000 USD available for up to
forty authors of accepted papers. 

All accepted papers will be considered for a travel grant. Accepted
papers are expected to be presented in-person. To submit work, see the
[submission page]({{site.baseurl}}/submission).

Travel grants will be announced concurrently with paper acceptances.
Staff at MBZUAI will assist grant recipients with securing their travel.
