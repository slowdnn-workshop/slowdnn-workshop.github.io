talk: 'The Next Generation of Reliable AI: From Digital to Analog Hardware'
abstract: "Artificial intelligence is currently leading to one breakthrough after the other, in the sciences, in industry, and in public life. However, one current major drawback is the lack of reliability of such methodologies, which, in particular, also concerns almost any application of deep neural networks.  In this lecture, we will first provide a short introduction into the world of reliability of deep neural networks, with one main focus being on explainability. We will, in particular, present a novel approach based on information theory, coined ShearletX, which allows to not only provide higher level explanations, but also reveals the reason for wrong decisions. We will then delve deeper and discuss fundamental limitations of numerous current deep learning-based approaches, showing that there do exist severe problems in terms of computability on any type of digital hardware, which seriously affects their reliability. But theory also shows a way out, pointing towards a future on analog hardware such as neuromorphic computing or quantum computing to achieve true reliability."
