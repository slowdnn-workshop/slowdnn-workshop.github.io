talk: "Beyond Classic Image Priors: Deep Reinforcement Learning and Disentangling for Image Restoration"
abstract: "The key to solving various ill-posed inverse problems, including many computational imaging and image restoration tasks, is to exploit effective image priors. The classic signal processing theory laid the foundation on constructing analytical image models such as sparse coding and low-rank approximation. Recent advances in machine learning, especially deep learning technologies have made incredible progress in the past few years, which enables people to rethink how the image prior can be formulated more effective. Despite those many deep learning methods achieved the state-of-the-art results in image restoration tasks, there are still limitations in practice, such as adversarial robustness, customization, generalization, and data-efficiency. In this talk, I will share some of our recent works on deep disentangling and deep reinforcement learning in image restoration tasks. We argue that learning more than just the classic image priors are needed for solving inverse problems to alleviate some of the limitations. We show promising results in several image restoration tasks, including denoising, adversarial purification, low-light image enhancement and computational imaging."
