talk: Demystifying Feature learning via gradient descent with applications to medical image reconstruction
abstract: "In this talk I will discuss the challenges and opportunities for using deep learning in medical image reconstruction. Contemporary techniques in this field rely on convolutional architectures that are limited by the spatial invariance of their filters and have difficulty modeling long-range dependencies. To remedy this, I will discuss our work on designing new transformer-based architectures called HUMUS-Net that lead to state of the art performance and do not suffer from these limitations. A key component in the success of the above approach is a unique feature learning capability of unrolled neural networks trained based on end-to-end training. In the second part of the talk I will demystify this feature learning capability of neural networks in this context as well as more broadly for other problems. Our result is based on an intriguing spectral bias phenomena for gradient descent, that puts the iterations on a particular trajectory towards solutions that learn good features that generalize well. Notably this analysis overcomes a major theoretical bottleneck in the existing literature and goes beyond the “lazy” training regime which requires unrealistic hyperparameter choices (e.g. very small step sizes, large initialization or wide models)."
