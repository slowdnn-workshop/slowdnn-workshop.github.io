talk: "How to learn a Table of Concepts?"
abstract: An idealized view of an intelligent system is one where there is a table of concepts from simple to complex and on each raw input (image or text) is processed to identify the concepts present or triggered by that input. While today's ML systems may use a Mixture of Experts or Table of entities/mentions that are trying to map concepts to experts/entities/mention, there is hardly a clear picture of how concepts build upon each other automatically. In the domain of images, we can think of commonly occurring shapes, types of motions as concepts and ask how would a visual system create entries for different shape types in a table of concepts. How does one convert raw data into concepts given by something like their latent representation. A trivial transformation like random projection  doesn't work. But we will see how simple networks similar to ones used in practice can be viewed as "sketching operators" that can be used to create representations for images with simple shapes that are isomorphic to their polynomial representations. By putting such polynomial representations in a locality sensitive table, we obtain a dictionary of curves. And then by recursively applying another layer of the sketching operator on the curves one gets a dictionary of concepts such as shapes.
