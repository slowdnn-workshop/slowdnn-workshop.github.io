talk: 'A key principle underlying deep networks: compositional sparsity'
abstract: 'A key question is whether there exist a theoretical explanation — a common motif — to the various network architectures, including the human brain, that perform so well in learning tasks. I will discuss the conjecture that this is compositional sparsity of  effectively computable functions:  all functions of many variables must effectively be compositionally sparse that is with constituent functions each depending on a small number of variables.'
