# Third Workshop on Seeking Low-Dimensionality in Deep Neural Networks (SLowDNN)
### January 2023,&nbsp;[MBZUAI](https://mbzuai.ac.ae/), Abu Dhabi

In the past decade, deep learning has demonstrated unprecedented performance
across many different domains. Modern neural networks learn high-performing
nonlinear representations for complex multi-modal data (e.g. text and image)
*without labels*; they generate near-photorealistic high-resolution images from
random noise; and they efficiently reconstruct data from compressive, corrupted
measurements in various imaging and structural prediction tasks.

However, despite recent endeavors, the underlying principles behind their
success remain a mystery. At a fundamental level, each of these successes, and
numerous others in scientific and engineering applications, stem from the
low-dimensional structure present both in the training data and in the networks
themselves. This presents a significant opportunity to bring insights from
better-understood low-dimensional models to the setting of deep learning, where
models are notoriously plagued by issues of poor resource and data efficiency,
robustness, and generalization.

Given these exciting but relatively less-exploited connections, this workshop
aims to bring together experts in machine learning, applied mathematics, signal
processing, and optimization, to share recent progress and foster
collaborations on the mathematical foundations of deep learning. As the
community continues to embrace the power of deep learning, with unprecedented
new challenges in terms of modeling and interpretability, we hope to stimulate
vibrant discussions towards bridging the gap between the theory and practice of
deep learning, with low-dimensionality as a unifying focus.
