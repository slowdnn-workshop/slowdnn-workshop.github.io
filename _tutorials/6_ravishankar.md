tutorial: "Advancing Machine Learning for Imaging -- Regularization and Robustness"
abstract: "In this talk, we present our work on improving machine learning for image reconstruction on three fronts -- i) learning regularizers, ii) learning with no training data, and iii) ensuring robustness to perturbations in learning-based schemes.  First, we present an approach for supervised learning of sparsity-promoting regularizers, where the parameters of the regularizer are learned to minimize reconstruction error on a paired training set. Training involves a challenging bilevel optimization problem with a nonsmooth lower-level objective. We derive an expression for the gradient of the training loss using the implicit closed-form solution of the lower-level variational problem, and provide an accompanying exact gradient descent algorithm (dubbed BLORC). Our experiments show that the gradient computation is efficient and BLORC learns meaningful operators for effective denoising. Second, we investigate the deep image prior (DIP) scheme that recovers an image by fitting an overparameterized neural network directly to the image's corrupted measurements. To address DIP's overfitting and performance issues, recent work proposed using a reference image as the network input. However, obtaining the reference often requires supervision. Hence, we propose a self-guided scheme that uses only undersampled measurements to estimate both the network weights and input image. We exploit regularization requiring the network to be a powerful denoiser. Our self-guided method gives significantly improved reconstructions for MRI with limited measurements compared to recent schemes, while using no training data. Finally, recent studies have shown that trained deep reconstruction models could be over-sensitive to  tiny input perturbations, which cause unstable, low-quality reconstructed images. To address this issue, we propose Smoothed Unrolling (SMUG), which incorporates a randomized smoothing-based robust learning operation into a deep unrolling architecture and improves the robustness of MRI reconstruction with respect to diverse perturbations."
