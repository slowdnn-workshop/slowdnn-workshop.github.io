tutorial: Learning Low-Dimensional Structure via Deep Networks
abstract: "We will discuss the contemporary topic of using deep models for computing with nonlinear data, introducing strong conceptual connections between low-dimensional structures in data and deep models. We will then consider a mathematical model problem that attempts to capture these aspects of practice, and show how low-dimensional structure in data and tasks influences the resources (statistical, architectural) required to achieve a given performance level. Our discussion will revolve around basic tradeoffs between these resources and theoretical guarantees of performance."
