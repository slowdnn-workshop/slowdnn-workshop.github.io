tutorial: Introduction to Low-Dimensional Models
abstract: "The first session will introduce fundamental properties and
theoretical results for sensing, processing, analyzing, and learning
low-dimensional structures from high-dimensional data. We will first discuss
classical low-dimensional models, such as sparse recovery and low-rank matrix
sensing, and motivate these models by applications in medical imaging,
collaborative filtering, face recognition, and beyond. Based on convex
relaxation, we will characterize the conditions, in terms of sample/data
complexity, under which the inverse problems of recovering such low-dimensional
structures become tractable and can be solved efficiently, with guaranteed
correctness or accuracy."
