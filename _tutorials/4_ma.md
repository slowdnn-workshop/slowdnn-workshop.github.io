tutorial: Design Deep Networks for Pursuing Low-Dimensional Structures
abstract: "Based upon the previous discussion on the connection between low-dimensional structures and deep models, in this section, we will discuss principles for designing deep networks through the lens of learning good low-dimensional representation for (potentially nonlinear) low-dimensional structures. We will see how unrolling iterative optimization algorithms for low-dimensional problems (such as the sparsifying algorithms) naturally lead to deep neural networks. We will then show how modern deep layered architectures, linear (convolution) operators, and nonlinear activations, and even all parameters can be derived from the principle of learning a compact linear discriminative representation for nonlinear low-dimensional structures within the data. We will show how so learned representations can bring tremendous benefits in tasks such as learning generative models, noise stability, and incremental learning."
