tutorial: Learned Representations and Low-Dimensional Structures
abstract: "Continuing our exploration of deep models for nonlinear data, we will begin to delve into learned representations, network architectures, regularizations, and beyond. We will see how the tools for nonconvexity developed previously shed light on the learned representations produced by deep networks, through connections to matrix factorization. We will observe how algorithms that interact with data will expose additional connections to low-dimensional models, through implicit regularization of the network parameters."
