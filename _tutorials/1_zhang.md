tutorial: "Nonconvex Optimization of Low-Dimensional Models"
abstract: "We will transit from sensing to learning low-dimensional structures, such as dictionary learning, sparse blind deconvolution, and dual principal component analysis. Problems associated with learning low-dimensional models from sample data are often nonconvex: either they do not have tractable convex relaxations or the nonconvex formulation is preferred due to physical or computational constraints (such as limited memory). To deal with these challenges, we will introduce a systematic approach of analyzing the corresponding nonconvex landscapes from a geometry and symmetry perspective. The resulting approach leads to provable globally convergent nonconvex optimization methods."
