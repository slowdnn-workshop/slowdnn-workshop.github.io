  Hotel](https://www.marriott.com/en-us/hotels/auhwh-w-abu-dhabi-yas-island/overview/), Abu Dhabi
- Submission portal opens: **October 1st, 2022**
- Paper submission deadline: **November 6th, 2022**
- Acceptance and travel grant notification: **November 20th, 2022**


# How to Submit Your Work

We will use OpenReview to manage submissions. Submit your work here:

[https://openreview.net/group?id=mbzuai.ac.ae/SLowDNN/2023/Workshop](https://openreview.net/group?id=mbzuai.ac.ae/SLowDNN/2023/Workshop)
{: .text-center .fs-6 }

See the [submission guidelines](#submission-guidelines) and
[topics of interest](#topics-of-interest).

# Logistics for Accepted Papers

Accepted works will be expected to present a poster describing the work
in-person at the workshop.

Travel grants are available to support authors of accepted papers: 
see [the travel page]({{site.baseurl}}/travel) for details.

A small subset of the top accepted papers will be recommended for inclusion in
a future special issue of the IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Signal
Processing.


# Topics of Interest

Topics of interest include, but are not limited to, connections between
low-dimensional models and the theory, architectures, algorithms, and
applications of deep neural networks:
- **Theory**: approximation, generalization,  robustness, compact and structured
  representations
- **Optimization**: Benign non-convex optimization, implicit bias analysis,
  convergence guarantees
- **Architectures**: compact/model-based/neuro-inspired/invariant neural networks
- **Algorithms**: pruning, sparse training, robust training 
- **Applications**: generative models, resource/data-efficient learning, inverse
  problems

# Submission Guidelines

We aim to showcase:

- **The latest research innovations** at all stages of the research process, from
  work-in-progress to recently published papers
- **Position or survey papers** on any topics relevant to this workshop (see
  [the call above](#topics-of-interest))

Concretely, we ask members of the community to submit a **conference-style
paper**
(from four to eight pages, with extra pages for references) describing the work. 
Please also upload a short (250 word) abstract to OpenReview.  Do not anonymize
submissions.

Papers should be written using the NeurIPS 2022 style files, available
[here](https://neurips.cc/Conferences/2022/PaperInformation/StyleFiles).

OpenReview submissions may also include any of the following supplemental
materials that describe the work in further detail. 
- **A poster** (in PDF form) presenting results of work-in-progress.
- **A link to a blog post** (e.g., distill.pub, Medium) describing results.
- **Appendices** with detailed derivations and additional experiments.

This workshop is non-archival, and it will not have proceedings. We permit
under-review or concurrent submissions. 

Reviewing will be performed in a single-blind fashion (authors should not
anonymize their submissions).
