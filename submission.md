# Topics of Interest

Topics of interest include, but are not limited to, connections between
low-dimensional models and the theory, architectures, algorithms, and
applications of deep neural networks:
- Theory: approximation, generalization,  robustness, compact and structured
  representations
- Optimization: Benign non-convex optimization, implicit bias analysis,
  convergence guarantees
