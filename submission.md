# How to Submit Your Work

We will use OpenReview to manage submissions. Submit your work here:

[https://openreview.net/group?id=mbzuai.ac.ae/SLowDNN/2023/Workshop](https://openreview.net/group?id=mbzuai.ac.ae/SLowDNN/2023/Workshop)

See the [submission guidelines](#submission-guidelines).

# Topics of Interest

Topics of interest include, but are not limited to, connections between
low-dimensional models and the theory, architectures, algorithms, and
applications of deep neural networks:
- **Theory**: approximation, generalization,  robustness, compact and structured
  representations
- **Optimization**: Benign non-convex optimization, implicit bias analysis,
  convergence guarantees
- **Architectures**: compact/model-based/neuro-inspired/invariant neural networks
- **Algorithms**: pruning, sparse training, robust training 
- **Applications**: generative models, resource/data-efficient learning, inverse
  problems

# Submission Guidelines

We aim to showcase:

- **The latest research innovations** at all stages of the research process, from
  work-in-progress to recently published papers
- **Position or survey papers** on any topics relevant to this workshop (see
  [the call above](#topics-of-interest))

Concretely, we ask members of the community to submit an **extended abstract**
(one page, without references) describing the work. 
Please also upload a short (250 word) abstract to OpenReview.
Abstracts should follow the NeurIPS 2022 style files, available
[here](https://neurips.cc/Conferences/2022/PaperInformation/StyleFiles).

OpenReview submissions may also include any of the following supplemental
materials that describe the work in further detail. 
- **A poster** (in PDF form) presenting results of work-in-progress.
- **A link to a blog post** (e.g., distill.pub, Medium) describing results.
- **Appendices** with detailed derivations and additional experiments.

This workshop is non-archival, and it will not have proceedings. We permit
under-review or concurrent submissions. 

Accepted works will be invited for in-person poster presentation at the workshop
at [MBZUAI](https://mbzuai.ac.ae/). See [the travel
page]({{site.baseurl}}/travel) for information about travel support to accepted
papers.
